# REQUIREMENT


## Introduction 
-Now a days the rate of Contineous usage of ambulance around our city has been increased a lot.
-So to avoid Ambulance to wait in a siganl if the signal is in Red sign, we can implement this project around our cities 
to make sure that ambulance or any other emergency vehicals need not wait until the particular signal turns green.

##Features
-The main  feature of this project is to avoid the wait time of an emergency vehical in a traffic signal.
-This helps in saving time which in turn helps in saving lifes. 

## SWOT- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities Threats

### Strengths
- User Friendly
- Easy to alter the traffic light to turn green if it is red.
- Modular Approach
- Low cost and very efficient.

### Weakness
- This may take lot of time to be implemented to all the traffic poles around the city. 

### Opportunities
- It can be implemented by Using basic microcontollers and sensors.
- The cost will not be two high 

### Threats 
- Time taken to implement this project will be high 
- The requirement of Man power to implement this project will be high.\

## 4W's and 1'H
### **WHAT** : Automatic Traffic Light System for Emergency Vehical
### **WHERE** : Used in Automotive Industries
### **WHEN** : At Very Emergency situations
### **Who** : By an Embedded Engineer 

### **How** : using SimulIDE and Embedded C
