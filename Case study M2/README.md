#Case study 


#Manual mode 
In a Manal mode the user will be setting the time limit and the type of food which is need to be prepared. 
Usually microwave ovens comes with many functional buttons where each button perform different functions like start/stop, setting time etc. 
Once we give input to the microwave oven then it will start cooking food. 

#Automatic mode
(Includes performance of sensors)
Automatic modes in microwave oven can perform various functions by its own when we implement certain sensor in it. 
Up to my idea i have included 3 different sensor.

#AH sensor (humidity sensor):
Humidity sensors are electronic devices that measure and report the moisture and air temperature of the surrounding environment where they are deployed e.g., in air, soil, or confined spaces. Humidity measurements indicate the concentration of water vapor presented in the air.

#Weight sensor :
Weight sensors can be  implemented in microwave oven so that the weight of the food will be calculated and it automatically set the time to make sure that the food kept inside is cooked perfectly.

#Temperature sensor :
Temperature sensor playes a major role in a microwave oven, there will be situations like food may be in a moderate heat. So if a microwave oven doesn't analyse it and heat the food at a very high level then there are chances in which the food gets spoiled. 

#Voice control
Let's take an perfect example Alexa
We all know about alexa which works on voice commands basis. 
Imagine if a microwave works under voice commands.
Example: The user kept the food inside the microwave oven before he leave home to office. When he come home again he can just give a voice command to the microwave telling " cook my food for 1min" so that the microwave start it's work with a voice command.
This can be implemented if we place a sound sensor to the microwave oven.
